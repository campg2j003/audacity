Compilation and install instructions for GNU/Linux

Download wxWidgets. Audacity 2.1.3 requires wxWidgets 3.0.x, preferably 3.0.2, 
which can be obtained from:
https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/releases/download/v3.0.2/wxWidgets-3.0.2.tar.bz2 .

Don't be tempted to use the Widgets version already installed on Linux because 
this will cause problems.

The libsndfile library is also required and is included in Audacity obtained 
from GitHub. Obtain the latest Audacity alpha development source code from 
https://github.com/audacity/audacity then use the green "Clone or download" 
button to git clone Audacity. You may need to install git first.  

If you are not planning to do any development, you may be better to download
the Audacity 2.1.3 release minimal source tarball from 
http://www.audacityteam.org/download/source/ .
 
CMake ( http://www.cmake.org/ ) is required to build the local copy of 
the libsoxr resampling library used by Audacity, unless you install 
libsoxr-dev and use that system library.

Installation of other libraries is optional, see:
http://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/Developing_On_Linux#optional . 

If you install libraries using a package management system like Apt or RPM,
you need to install the "dev" (development) packages for each library.

Compile wxWidgets with the default gtk2 option, not with gtk3:

   ./configure
   make

Install wxWidgets (this defaults to installation in /usr/local/). 

   make install # as root
   ldconfig  # as root 

The root command is often sudo on GNU/Linux, for example 'sudo make install'.

Then to compile and install Audacity: 

   ./configure -with-lib-preference="local system"
   make
   make install  # as root

To see the compile-time options you can set, type
   ./configure --help

If you want to do any development, you might want to generate a configure cache
and header dependencies:

   ./configure -C
   make dep
